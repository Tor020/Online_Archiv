        <h2>Events involving Wordpress Personal Website as of 4-18-2017 </h2>
        </div>
        
          <p>
        Kcwebdevoh.online domain name purchased from <a href="gandi.net">gandi.net</a>
        Purchased hosting from <a href="digitalocean.com">digitalocean</a> installed package came with ubuntu 16.04 w/ WordPress built-in. 
        phpmyadmin via unix terminal manually installed and set up secure private/public key via <a class = 'dead' href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">putty</a>
        allowing for editing of various files via <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/index.php">sshftp</a>.
        </p>
       <p>
         When I updated the updated the url address in the wordpress admin panel after setting up the domain name ssl certificate, it broke the current wordpress theme. Changing the theme
         didn't solve the problem. While troubleshooting from WP support documentation, I editting some of the php files. None of what I did proved effective at fixing the current theme.</p>
         <p>
        Ultimately one of the file edits caused the website to be inaccessible by both ip address and domain name.
        After spending several hours reading through error logs checking the web services that were running and other various debugging techniques with minimal progress towards recovery
        it was ultimately decided to postpone moving forward with personal server setup due to it being more efficient to spend time compounding
        Front End knowledge.
        </p> 
        <h3>Personal Take</h3>
         <p>
           Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with what I got out of this experience. I learned a lot of new things from it altogether and got to experience another big part of web development Of which I had none prior</p>
         <p>It was my first time:
          <ul>
            <li>using a unix terminal to navigate system folders and install/update software </li>
            <li>making an ssh key and using a ftp</li>
            <li>using the wordpress backend</li>
            <li>configuring an ssl ticket</li>
            <li>restarting server webservices to test changes</li>
            <li>troubleshooting via error logs</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
           I've looked into php fundamentals but don't have a strong grasp of the syntax yet as at time of writing I'm
           still trying to master javascript. I still have long term aspirations of being a full stack web developer and I enjoyed the new challenge this posed.
